### Automobile Deaths (under construction)
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) maintains a database of every reported traffic fatality in the United States. This database is called FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System), which has been maintained since 1975.

Currently, doing visualization and EDA on some of the recent years' data using Tableau.

In the long term, could use the data from Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) to analyze and make a linear regression model that predicts the fatality rate of a car model.
